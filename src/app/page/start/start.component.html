    <p>In my and my wife's families we always randomize who is gonna buy a christmas gift to whom.<br>
      Not does this only save alot of money but it also ease up on the stress that christmas is highly associated with.</p>
    
    <p>Although all of the generators available online (atleast from what I've found) is way too complex, requires emails and yadayada.<br>
    So therefore I decided to make this simple generator.</p>
    <p>Simply type in the names of the participants to the left, press the "randomize"-button and it's all done!</p>
